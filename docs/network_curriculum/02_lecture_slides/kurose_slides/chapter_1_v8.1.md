### Slide 30: Packet-switching: store-and-forward

* packet transmission delay:
* takes
* L
* /
* R
* seconds to transmit (push out)
* L
* -bit packet into link at
* R
* bps
* store and forward:
* entire
* packet must  arrive at router before it can be transmitted on next link
* source
* R
* bps
* destination

* L
* bits

* R
* bps
* One-hop numerical example:

* R
* = 100 Mb/s

* = 1.5 Mb/s
* D
* E
* queue
* of packets
* waiting for transmission over output link
* Packet queuing and loss:
* i
* f arrival rate (in bps) to link exceeds transmission rate (bps) of link for some period of time:
* packets will queue, waiting to be transmitted on output link
* packets can be dropped (lost) if memory (buffer) in router fills up

### Slide 33: Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching

* end-end resources allocated to, reserved for “
* call” between source and destination
* in diagram, each link has four circuits.
* call gets 2
* nd
* circuit in top link and 1
* st
* circuit in right link.
* dedicated resources: no sharing
* circuit-like (guaranteed) performance
* circuit segment idle if not used by call
* (no sharing)

* (FDM)
* optical, electromagnetic frequencies divided into (narrow) frequency bands
* Time
* Division Multiplexing
* (TDM)
* time divided into slots

### Slide 35: Packet switching versus circuit switching

* example:
* 1 Gb/s link
* each user:
* 100 Mb/s when
* “active”
* active 10% of time
* Q:
* how many users can use this network under circuit-switching and packet switching?
* * Check out the online interactive exercises for more examples: h
* ttp://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/interactive
* N
* users
* 1 Gbps link
* …..
* circuit-switching:
* 10 users
* Q:
* how did we get value 0.0004?
* A:
* HW problem
* (for those with course in probability only)
* packet switching:
* with 35 users, probability > 10 active at same time is less than .0004 *

### Slide 36: Packet switching versus circuit switching

* great for “bursty” data – sometimes has data to send, but at other times not
* resource sharing
* simpler, no call setup
* excessive congestion possible:
* packet delay and loss due to buffer overflow
* protocols needed for reliable data transfer, congestion control
* Q:
* How to provide circuit-like behavior with packet-switching?
* “It’s complicated.” We’ll study various techniques that try to make packet switching as “circuit-like” as possible.
* Is packet switching a “
* slam dunk winner”?
* Q:
* human analogies of reserved resources (circuit switching) versus on-demand allocation (packet switching)?

### Slide 37: Internet structure: a “network of networks”

* hosts connect to Internet via
* access
* Internet Service Providers (ISPs)
* access ISPs in turn must be interconnected
* so that
* any
* two hosts
* (anywhere!)
* can send packets to each other
* resulting network of networks is very complex
* evolution driven by

* national policies

### Slide 77: Chapter 1: roadmap

* Introduction: 1-
* 77
* What
* is
* the Internet?
* What
* is
* a protocol?
* Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
* Network core: packet/circuit switching, internet structure
* Performance: loss, delay, throughput

* s:
* ARPAnet decommissioned
* 1991:
* NSF lifts restrictions on commercial use of NSFnet (decommissioned, 1995)
* early 1990s:
* Web
* hypertext
* [Bush 1945, Nelson 1960
* ’
* s]

### Slide 82: Internet history

* aggressive deployment of broadband home access (10-100’s Mbps)
* 2008: software-defined networking (SDN)
* increasing ubiquity of high-speed wireless access: 4G/5G, WiFi
* service providers
* (Google, FB, Microsoft
* ) create their own networks
* bypass commercial Internet to connect “close” to end user, providing
* “
* instantaneous
* ”
* access to social media, search, video content, …
* enterprises run their services in “
* cloud”
* (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure)
* rise of smartphones: more mobile than fixed devices on Internet
* (2017)
* ~18B devices attached to Internet
* (2017)
* 2005-present: scale, SDN, mobility, cloud

### Slide 83: Chapter 1: summary

* Introduction: 1-
* 83
* We’ve covered a “
* ton” of material!
* Internet overview
* what
* ’
* s a protocol?
* network edge, access network, core
* packet-switching versus circuit-switching
* Internet structure
* performance: loss, delay, throughput
* layering, service models
* security
* history
* You now have:
* context, overview, vocabulary,  “
* feel” of networking
* more depth, detail,
* and fun
* to follow

* Introduction: 1-
* 85
* Two layers not found in  Internet protocol stack!
* presentation:
* allow applications to interpret meaning of data, e.g., encryption, compression, machine-specific conventions
* session:
* synchronization, checkpointing, recovery of data exchange
* Internet stack “
* missing” these layers!
* these services,
* if needed,
* must be implemented in application
* needed?
